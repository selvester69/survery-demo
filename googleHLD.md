I can definitely do that. It seems like you want me to combine the project requirements you provided with the High-Level Design (HLD) I generated, to create a single, comprehensive document.

Here is a combined document that starts with the project overview and requirements, followed by the HLD that details the architecture and data flow.

***

### **Client Survey Application: Complete Development Plan & High-Level Design**

#### **1. Project Overview & Core Requirements**

This project involves building a professional survey application for a client, complete with an **admin module, analytics dashboard, and location tracking**. It is a full-featured survey platform for business use.

* **Admin Module:** Includes CRUD operations for surveys and questions, link generation, analytics dashboards, and user management.
* **Survey Distribution:** Creates unique, shareable URLs and manages their performance. Optional features like password protection and access restrictions are supported.
* **Analytics & Reporting:** Provides real-time response tracking, data visualization (charts, graphs), and export capabilities (Excel, CSV, PDF).
* **Location Tracking:** Captures GPS coordinates or uses IP-based location as a fallback, along with timezone and device information.

#### **2. Technical Architecture**

The application will use a modern **React.js** frontend with **Redux Toolkit** and **Tailwind CSS**. The backend will be a **RESTful API** connected to a **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** database.

* **Frontend:** React.js 18+, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Recharts/Chart.js, Leaflet.js, Day.js.
* **Backend:** Node.js/Java/Python (to be determined), RESTful API, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Cloud storage for files.

#### **3. Core Components**

The system is split into two main component sets:

* **Admin Dashboard Components:** Manages the entire survey lifecycle, from creation (`SurveyBuilder`) to analysis (`Analytics/ResponseAnalytics`).
* **Survey Taking Components:** The public-facing interface for respondents to fill out surveys, handling question rendering, progress tracking, and location capture.

---

### **4. High-Level Design (HLD)**

The application will use a **Microservice-like/Modular Monolith architecture** to separate the Admin and Survey Taker applications, connected via a RESTful API.

#### **System Context and Architectural Overview**

1. **Frontend Clients:**
    * **Admin Dashboard:** The secured, role-based application for management.
    * **Survey Taker Interface:** The public, high-performance application for respondents.

2. **API Gateway/Backend Service:** A single entry point that handles all API requests, routing them to the appropriate backend module.

3. **Core Services/Modules:**
    * **Auth Module:** Manages admin authentication and user roles.
    * **Survey Module:** Handles survey and question CRUD operations.
    * **Response Module:** Processes and saves survey submissions and answers.
    * **Analytics Module:** Aggregates and processes data for real-time dashboards and reports.
    * **Location/Metadata Module:** Integrates with geolocation services and processes location data.

4. **Data Layer:**
    * **Primary Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores relational data like `surveys`, `questions`, `users`, and `links`.
    * **Response Database (MongoDB):** Recommended for flexible storage of `responses` and `answers` due to their dynamic nature.

#### **5. Data Flow: Survey Submission**

This is the most critical path, ensuring data is collected efficiently.

1. A respondent accesses a unique survey link.
2. The **Survey Taker Interface** captures location and device information.
3. The frontend sends a `POST` request to the **API Gateway** to retrieve the survey questions.
4. The **Response Module** validates the link and fetches the survey structure from the database.
5. After completion, the frontend sends a final `POST` request with the answers and metadata.
6. The **Response Module** validates the submission and saves the data to the **Response Database**.
7. A background event is triggered, and the **Analytics Module** processes the new response, updating real-time dashboards.

#### **6. Backend Module Breakdown**

| Module | Core Functionality | Technologies/Data Stores |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auth** | Admin user authentication and roles. | PostgreSQL, JWT Tokens |
| **Survey** | CRUD for surveys and questions. | PostgreSQL |
| **Link** | Unique ID and QR code generation, link tracking. | PostgreSQL, Redis (caching) |
| **Response** | Handles validation and saving of submissions. | MongoDB/PostgreSQL |
| **Analytics** | Data aggregation and report generation. | MongoDB, Background Workers |
| **Location/Metadata** | Integrates with geolocation APIs. | External APIs |

#### **7. Data Storage Design (Refined)**

* **`surveys`, `questions`, `survey_links`, `admin_users`:** Stored in **PostgreSQL** for relational integrity.
* **`responses`, `answers`:** Stored in **MongoDB** as JSON documents for a flexible schema that can handle various question types and metadata.

This combined document provides a complete picture, from the initial high-level requirements to the specific architectural and data-flow decisions needed for implementation.
